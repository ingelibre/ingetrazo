# SKP import backend seam

IngeTrazo aims to open **any** `.skp` (old → recent). This document describes
the single seam that decouples the app from *how* a `.skp` is read.

## Backends

- **OpenSKP** (pure Python, MIT — https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp).
  Offline, Linux-native, no Wine, no proprietary DLL. **Wired and working** (see
  "What works / what's missing"). An **optional dependency**: `pip install
  openskp` (pulls `trimesh`). Not in `requirements.txt` yet — the seam falls
  back gracefully when it's absent.
- **skp2dae** (Trimble's `SketchUpAPI.dll` via Wine). The full-coverage
  fallback: a SEPARATE program (the DLL never enters GPL IngeTrazo). Its
  install/dialog/subprocess flow stays in `views/main_window.py`.

## The seam — `formats/skp.py`

**Parse then apply.** A backend *parses* a file into a plain **payload** (world-
space face loops), touching no `Scene`. The heavy parse runs *outside* the undo
history; `apply_payload` then adds the geometry cheaply inside a command — so a
failed or empty parse never leaves a half-applied edit.

Public API:

- `detect_format(path) -> "skp" | "unknown"` — from the first bytes. Real `.skp`
  files (legacy MFC **and** 2021+) begin with the same UTF-16 `SketchUp Model`
  marker (or a `PK` ZIP wrapper), so the *era* is **not** observable from the
  magic bytes — and doesn't need to be, since OpenSKP handles the range.
- `can_handle(path) -> bool` — a pure backend is available and recognises it
  (does not guarantee a non-empty parse).
- `parse_skp(path, progress=None) -> payload` — first backend that yields
  geometry; raises `NeedsConverter` on an unrecognised file, a parser error, or
  an empty parse.
- `apply_payload(scene, payload) -> backend_name` — add the payload as reference
  groups.
- `load_skp(scene, path)` — `apply_payload(parse_skp(...))`, for the diff harness.
- `NeedsConverter`, `backends_status()`.

Backends implement `available()`, `supports(fmt)`, `parse(path, progress)`.

### Cascade in the UI

`views/main_window.py::import_skp_path`:

1. If `can_handle(skp)` → `parse_skp` (outside history). Non-empty → apply
   through `SnapshotImport`. Empty/`NeedsConverter` → step 2.
2. **skp2dae** converter (Wine).

## The OpenSKP adapter — `formats/skp_openskp.py`

Isolated so `import openskp` is lazy. OpenSKP 0.2.0 model (by introspection):

- `SkpFile.open(path).parse()` → `SkpModel(definitions, materials, layers,
  version)`.
- `Definition(id, name, vertices{id→Vertex(x,y,z)}, edges{id→Edge(v1_id,v2_id)},
  faces{id→Face}, instances[Instance])`.
- `Face(loops, normal, material_id)`; each loop is `[(edge_id, sense), …]`,
  first = outer, rest = holes; `sense` 1 walks `v1→v2`.
- `Instance(matrix[13], ref_idx→def id, children)` — 3×3 row-major + translation.

SketchUp is **inches, Z-up** (same up axis as IngeTrazo) → scale ×0.0254, no
axis swap. The instance tree is flattened to world-space polygons (reference
geometry, one group). Enable/disable via `_OpenSkpBackend` in `formats/skp.py`.

## What works / what's missing (measured with `scripts/skp_diff.py`)

Validated against the skp2dae/Trimble oracle on real files (e.g. `demuna.skp`,
SketchUp 2022):

- ✅ **Bounding box exact** — units, Z-up and instance transforms correct.
- ✅ **Geometry ~90–95% complete** — faces/vertices/triangles within ~5–9% of
  the oracle.
- ✅ **Materials / colours** — resolved. `Face.material_id` joins through
  `SkpModel.materials_by_id`, added by **our upstream PR**
  ([openskp#3](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/pull/3)).
- ✅ **Textures** — resolved. `Material.texture` (image bytes + tile size in
  inches), added by **our upstream PR**
  ([openskp#4](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/pull/4)). The adapter
  writes the images to `<stem>/` beside the `.skp` (the SketchUp-export
  convention skp2dae also uses) and maps them with IngeTrazo's planar
  projection at the material's real tile size. Measured: **18/18 materials and
  2/2 textures — exact parity with the oracle**; those rows no longer appear
  in the diff.
  Until the PRs ship on PyPI, install from the integration branch:
  `pip install git+https://github.com/tuxiasumari/openskp@ingetrazo#subdirectory=packages/python`
  (branch `ingetrazo` = upstream `main` + both PR branches merged). With PyPI
  0.2.0 (no joins) faces import uncoloured.
- ⚠️ **Grouping** — flattened to one group (skp2dae splits by node); cosmetic.
- ⚠️ **~5–9% of faces skipped** — degenerate/unresolved loops; to investigate.

These gaps are the concrete contribution targets for OpenSKP (see
`docs/openskp-collaboration.md`). Geometry — the hard part — already works.
